blkdev-test
-----------

This repo contains some simple tools for playing around with O_DIRECT
access to block devices.

block.c
-------

A simple C program to open a block device, get certain properties and
perform some IO against it. A few notes:

1. The stat property st_size is NOT a good way of getting the capacity
of the block device. Use seek instead.

test
----

A wee shell script to create a small random file, attach that to a
spare loop device and then do some tests against it.

Other Notes
-----------

1. You might find it interest to run test while also running blktrace
on the block device.
